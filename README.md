# The 5 planes of UX

- When thinking on designing this site i took into mind the 5 planes that had been highlighted during the course previously. This made the overall process easier to plan-out.

- ## <u>The strategy</u>
    

- ## <u>The Scope</u>
    

- ## <u>The Structure</u>

## Wireframes

![wireframe collection]()

- Above is a summary of the wireframes for this site (The desktop view). The basis of the site is very simple. One main landing page, one structure for the page that will contain the recipes (content will change but the structure remains the same), and one contact form page. Below are the links to the full images and their respective mobile views.

# The Coding Languages and Techniques Used

- This site was constructed using:
    - HTML5
    - CSS3
    - Bootstrap 4.2.1
    - Fontawesome
   



# Method of Deployment

- To fully test the site on multiple 'real-world' devices I needed to create a live link to the site that could be accessed universally. To do this, a simple procedure is required. 

    - Step 1: Open Github.com and sign in.
    - Step 2: Once signed in you should see your repositorys in chronological order.
    - Step 3: Select the repository you wish to create a link for and once selected click the settings tab on the page.
    - Step 4: Within the settings page you will be given the option to rename the repository, add an image to customize your social media preview, and many other options to be explored at a later date.
    - Step 5: Scroll down and you will find the heading for GitHub Pages.
    - Step 6: At this stage the 'source' field should read 'none' so click on the button and select 'master'
    - Step 7: Once this is selected, hit save and the page should refresh bringing you back to the top.
    - Step 8: Scroll back down to the Github pages section and you will now see a message informing the user that the site is ready to be published and a highlighted link. Make a note of the link address for future reference or click the link to access the site direct. 

- From this point on you can type in and access your site on any device with an internet browser which is ideal for testing purposes.

## For those wishing to develop the site further using a repository clone:
- You must first ensure that you have a current Github account.
- Be running the most up to date version of Google Chrome with the Gitpod browser extension installed.
- Login to Github with your own github account.
- Navigate to the Project Github Repository page.
- Click the New button, this will trigger a new workspace.
- Under Create a new Repository select Import a Repository
- Now, in the Your Old Repository Clone URL field, type in ""
- Enter in a new relevant repository name and click Begin Import.
- After a short while you'll recieve a message saying that the new repository is ready with a link to take you to it.
- From here on, open gipod and continue future developments.  

# Methods of Testing

- Throughout the development stage I used a handful of methods to ensure the site looked and acted appropriately.<br> These included:

    - Chrome Dev Tools - for testing stylings, sizing, and responsiveness

    - Mozilla Dev Tools - for testing stylings, sizing, and responsiveness

    - http://ami.responsivedesign.is/ - again for testing stylings, sizing, and responsiveness.

    - https://coolors.co/ - for picking color schemes and testing contrast colors

    - Github Pages - to access the live site across different devices

    - Google Lighthouse - to test perfomance 


## Summary of User Testing



    ## Problems and bugs experienced along the way

- Problem: Subtitle on easylevel.html stuck to left side of page
    - Solution: Adjusted styling width to 100%
- Problem: Trying to have timer and first question appear when start button is pressed.
    - Solution: Moved the timer code inside the function targeted by the onclick function.
- Problem: "Random sums are actually just repeating the sum question instead of generating a new sum.
    - Solution
- Problem: Getting this error message "script.js:160 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot set property 'textContent' of null
    at startGame (script.js:160)at HTMLButtonElement.onclick (mediumlevel.html:32)"
- Problem: Screen jumping when hovered over answer box
